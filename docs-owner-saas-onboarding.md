# SaaS Account onboarding

Deploy with the backend owner-onboarding change and run its database migration first.

- `isCompanyOwner`, `paidAccessRequired` and `effectivePermissions` come from Django authentication responses.
- After login/password setup the owner lands at `/account`. Staff use their effective workshop permissions.
- The access endpoint remains the live source of navigation and route permissions. Every `/account` route and wallet balance chip is hidden from non-owners, including wildcard staff.
- A newly registered company has no workshop modules or Dashboard until an owner activates paid access. Unpriced modules appear in the catalogue without an activation action.
- Account → Logs contains feature On/Off/resume events and persisted monthly usage statements. Disabled labels retain business records and can resume already-paid access.
- The company slug is shown as the tenant identifier. A configured wildcard address still requires operator-provisioned DNS/TLS/hosting; this frontend does not provision a subdomain.

Production build requires `VITE_API_URL` pointing to the matching Django `/api/v1` deployment. Test coverage for owner landing and effective permissions is in `tests/ownerOnboarding.test.js`.

Owners use a shared layout with a persistent sidebar on desktop and horizontally scrollable navigation on mobile. SaaS Account, Profile and Shop Details are always available. Other links appear only when the live server feature/role intersection authorizes them; Dashboard requires its own entitlement. Unpaid settings, storage and templates remain blocked on direct navigation too.

With no active modules, owners can open purchase/recovery routes, `/profile` and `/account/company`. Shop Details reads and updates only the tenant-scoped `/company/me` API; it does not mount paid settings, storage or billing services. Staff without an authorized module see a locked-access notice with refresh/sign-out. Unavailable access verification also displays this notice. Operational routes always keep their server-derived permission checks.

Pair this UI with backend migration `companies.0004_lock_existing_company_modules`, which enables paid-module enforcement for existing companies while preserving purchases. This UI continues to use the authoritative backend policy and entitlements.

Feature Controls lists all billable modules. Unpriced/unpublished modules show 0 credits and Price not set with activation disabled. They use read-only catalogue placeholders, never free purchases. A positive published per-user price is required for a new purchase.

Monthly postpaid recovery: the server access response supplies `billingStatus`. A positive overdue closed-month debt restricts workspace navigation, including otherwise-free Dashboard/Staff. Owners retain account recovery and read-only Storage/history routes. Storage is now an owner billing tab regardless of paid storage entitlement; file writes and policy changes still require storage.manage. Overdue staff receive a contact-owner notice. Access refreshes every minute while monthly collection is configured and after credit updates.

Feature cards distinguish monthly postpaid from prepaid: a verified positive postpaid quote can activate with zero wallet balance, with usage payable on the configured next-month due date. Missing/zero prices and inactive backend billing remain blocked. Overdue debt blocks new activation; owners can still stop existing usage and buy credits. Monthly statements display due dates and overdue state. Deploy with backend migrations 0012–0014 and configure its monthly metering/worker switches; see backend docs/monthly-due-date-storage-account.md.
